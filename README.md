# Health-Care-Center

Health care center is android based application which aims the purpose of collecting the donated medicines and organizing them through our portal. 
This API includes three interfaces namely: 
          Blood Donation System
          Medicine Donation System
          Money Donation System. 
The software requirement for this android application is Android Studio. 
In this interface, the donor needs to fill the form of the particular interfaces; the data filled by the donors can be seen in the NGO section only to the Authorized NGO workers. 
The main objective for development of this project is to reduce the medical wastage. 
People can also send the request in the individual interfaces who are in need for medicines. 
The NGO section can see those requests and distribute them to the donor. 
The bridge of communication between these two interfaces i.e., Donor and NGO can be done with the help of phone number which is taken from the donor while the time of registration; and also, with the help of email which is provided by user. 
The Money Donation interface is the main source of attraction.
Those people who don't have sources to donate but are willing to grant donation can directly donate money using our application.
